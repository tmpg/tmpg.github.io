<h1 id="meet-tim-pirog">Meet <a href="mailto:me@timpirog.com" target="_blank">Tim Pirog</a></h1>

My former self, undergraduate Tim, was invited to meet the multinational conglomerate CIO over lunch. This was a rare opportunity for an intern such as myself, and I was eager to gain his personal perspective.

How did he, CIO of a major corporation, achieve success and what should I be doing to get there? 

*Work hard, seize opportunities, do what you love, stay focused.*

At the time, this seemed to be no more than a generic, perfunctory response, similar to what would be said in a company-wide address or a public press conference. I felt I was already doing those things, and there must be some hidden key I was missing.

Young and overzealous, I did not realize that although those principles may be simple, they do not easily withstand the test of time.

*Work hard, seize opportunities, do what you love, stay focused.*

Years later, a wiser version of myself came to understand the honesty and depth in those responses. Work hard consistently. Play to your strengths. Direct your focus in the right areas. Understand yourself: what motivates you, what slows you down, and how to overcome.
