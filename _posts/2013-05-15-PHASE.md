> An innovative solution for gaming on the go, PHASE (PHASE Handheld Addon for Smart Electronics) provides a precision interface for mobile users

## Problem Definition
Smart devices are becoming major competitors in the handheld gaming market. These devices possess processing capabilities comparable to modern handheld game systems such as the Nintendo 3DS or PlayStation Vita. What differentiates smartphones from these handheld gaming platforms is their physical interface. While handheld game systems possess physical buttons and joysticks, smart devices often implement controls via their capacitive touchscreen. This is where smart devices are at a disadvantage ‐ gamers prefer the accuracy, feedback, and feel of physical controls as opposed to the on‐screen buttons on a capacitive touchscreen.
 

## Proposed Solution
The goal of this project is to design a peripheral that can universally interact with all smart devices and provide a physical gaming interface for the gamer. 

## Design

#### Concept
The device snaps into the controller with a universal attachment. The controller provides physical buttons for gameplay and communicates with the device over a Bluetooth connection.

#### Proof of Concept & Rapid Prototyping

PHASE utilizes an Arduino development platform to handle all instruction processing. It can communicate with a smart device using the Bluetooth Standard. In our PoC (seen above), a PlayStation controller is used in lieu of the encasement and provided physical components and controls.  

Once a proof-of-concept was established we started to improve the internals and physical design. Utilizing Solidworks (see below) and 3D printing, we were able to preform multiple iteration and improve PHASE's design within days.

#### Working Prototype
Our PHASE prototype is able to translate physical analog inputs and communicate with smart operating systems via Bluetooth. A hard-shell ergonomic enclosure has also been designed (seen below) which encases PHASE components and provides a phone specific insert.

## Results
In three months time, our team was able to take our concept and make a working prototype to showcase at Stevens Senior Design Expo 2013. For our efforts, the team was given the Senior Design Award for ECE.
